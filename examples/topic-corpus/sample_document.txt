British snooker commentator Ted Lowe has died at the age of 90. Lowe,
who received the nickname "Whispering Ted" due to his broadcasting style
commentated on many of snooker's biggest events including the 1985 World
Final between Steve Davis and Dennis Taylor. His death has come on the
same day as the first session of the 2011 Snooker World Final.

His wife, Jean commented on his death. She said "His health had been
deteriorating for the last 10 weeks. He went into a hospice a week ago
and I never left his side. But I could see he was slowly going. He still
loves snooker and was watching it on TV."

Tributes have been paid to Lowe by several snooker players and
commentators. John Virgo said "He set a standard for us all. He was
wonderful, he had an impish sense of humour and while cricket had its
John Arlott and Wimbledon had its Dan Maskell, we had Ted Lowe. He was one
of the BBC greats. It's a sad day for snooker and he'll be sadly missed."

Jimmy White also posted a message on social networking site Twitter saying
"Still in shock and so saddened. Absolutely gutted. He was a great friend
of my dad's and an absolute gentleman. I loved him dearly."

As well as commentating on snooker tournaments Lowe hosted the BBC
television programme Pot Black. Lowe is also remembered by viewers for his
quote after colour televisions started to appear. During a game he said
"He's going for the pink, and for those of you with black-and-white sets,
the yellow is behind the blue."
